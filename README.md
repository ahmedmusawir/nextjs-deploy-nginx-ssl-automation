Next.js Deployment & CI/CD Automation w/ Nginx & SSL using Certbot & Let's Encrypt

## Plz use the nginx-ssl-setup.py instead of nginx-ssl-setup-youtube.py

The youtube one is shown in the video ... which works, but upon further testing I found out that the certbot part of the script is flakey when run by the script. So I decided to show the list of commands at the end so that the admin can run them and test them manually. That works all the time.
